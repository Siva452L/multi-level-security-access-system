# Multi-Level Security Access System

This project implements a **Multi-Level Security Access System** using Embedded C (Keil / LPC2124).  
It combines RFID, Password, and Fingerprint authentication for enhanced security.

## Features
- RFID-based user identification
- Password verification with limited attempts
- Fingerprint verification for third-level authentication
- Simulated peripherals: LCD, Keypad, Motor, EEPROM, UART
- EEPROM emulation for password storage
- Simple C89-compatible embedded design

## How to Run
1. Compile the program using a C compiler (Keil µVision, GCC, or any online IDE).
2. Run the program in a console or simulator.
3. Follow on-screen prompts to enter RFID card, password, and fingerprint input.

## File
- `multi_level_security_access_system.c` → main source code

## Concepts Used
- EEPROM memory simulation
- Multi-level authentication logic
- Embedded peripheral interfacing
- Modular structured C programming
